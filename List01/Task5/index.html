            <p> 
                Wschowa has a long and fascinating history dating back to the 
                12th century. It was granted city rights in 1345 by King Casimir
                III the Great. Over the centuries, Wschowa became an important 
                trade and cultural center between Greater Poland and Silesia.
                During the Renaissance period, the town flourished as a royal 
                city and a hub for Protestant culture. Its history is reflected 
                in the town’s architecture, cobblestone streets, and old churches.
